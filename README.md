Battle of Langs
=

*The same algorithm in all of languages! Did you can improve that ?*

####About!

- For Frameworks battles use the directory frameworks!
	- And if you make the battle fork first, you need to provide a front-end part (or no!)

- For CLI applications... Just do that **LOL**

## To Forks...

Create your own test (algorithm) and make on your prefered language, pull to this repo and wait anyone beat that!
