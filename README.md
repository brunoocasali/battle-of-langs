Battle of Langs
=

*The same algorithm in all of languages! Can you add/improve a lang?*

#### How it works?

You need to create a new folder and put your challenge here.
Each folder should contain only one algorithm, written in various languages!
See the `base-cli` or `base-framework` folders to write your own challenge!

### Getting Started

##### For Frameworks *(Django, Ruby on Rails)* 
- Copy the `base-frameworks` folder
- Put your *best* explanation following the base in the markdown archive `INSTRUCTIONS.md` to anyone understand wtf you want!
- If you want, and it's better! Do the front-end for all to follow the same pattern! and put them inside `my-framework-challenge/front-end`
- Edit this archive adding on the **So Far** heading your challenge!

##### For CLI apps *(Console stuff)*
- Copy the `base-cli` folder
- Put your *best* explanation following the base in the markdown archive `INSTRUCTIONS.md` to anyone understand wtf you want!
- Edit this archive adding on the **So Far** heading your challenge!
